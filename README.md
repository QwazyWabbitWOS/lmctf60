# lmctf60
# LM_CTF for Quake II

This is the source code to LM_CTF Version 5.2 Tournament Edition.
The version has been bumped to 6.0 but I have no idea what the differences may be between the 1999 5.2 Edition and this one. This version came to me as 6.0 and I will be incrementing from there as I make functional changes. 

I've modified the code for modern ISO C (C11) and added some diagnostics. The original code had numerous warnings and the original make files write about them. There were also modules that were not properly compiled and linked. I don't work that way. I have created a new GNUmakefile to make it painless to build the code on Linux distros. The Visual Studio 2019 project is also warning-free at /W4 and has zero IntelliSense warnings. The GNUmakefile has also been modified and updated to eliminate a lot of options that are no longer needed or are now obsolete on gcc. This version compiles cleanly with no warnings on gcc version 6.3.0 20170516 (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1), gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.11) 5.4.0 20160609 and Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.2), gcc 8.x on Debian Linux reports warnings about potential buffer overflows due to tightened reporting of snprintf, sprintf and strncpy functions.
If you modify this code and encounter warnings they are all yours. :)
